### Good V.S Bad Design

For good design, I chose to go with a backpack. When thinking about the user experience, I think the backpack is something that is overlooked and underappreciated. 
Not only is the product versatile to meet the needs of each individual, but it also mantains certain constants which don't change with the design. One of these 
constants are the straps. What makes these straps integral to the design is that they are adjustable. It doesn't matter how tall or short you may be, the straps 
will always work with your body type. What makes the user experience unique though, is how customizable the product is. You can pick a backpack with more pockets,
larger straps or even one that is a quarter of the usual size. The capability to make the backpack your own, as well as have it cater to a wider audience by making
the straps adjustable, are just some reasons as to why it has great design.

For bad design, I chose a Clorox wipe box. In this specific case, the bad design is on the inside. Many times when you take a wipe out of the box, the wipes do not
separate as well as they should. When this happens, the number of wipes which come out are more than what you wanted, or the wipe falls through the hole. When the 
wipe falls through, this is especially difficult since the hole in the clorox box isn't large enough to get it back. This is an example of bad design, 
since it doesn't solve the issue of what you  do when the wipe is not ready to pull. This is a recurring theme not only in wipe boxes, but also a tissue box and 
other places where you are pulling an item out that can potentially drop back in.
